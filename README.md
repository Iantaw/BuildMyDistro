# BuildMyDistro

# What it is

It's a platform that lets you customize your own linux distro to your liking.

# How it works

After slecting all your options, an AI will generate you a .sh file and some instructions will pop up. If you follow the instructions correctly by running your .sh file you should see the changes immediately.

# Notes

I could possibly use the gemini flash 2.5 API to generate the .sh files.
